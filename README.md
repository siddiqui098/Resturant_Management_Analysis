# Methodology
Initially, there were null values in the item_id column because the data was stored in an Excel file. Before importing the data into SQL and creating the database, I processed and cleaned it in Excel. This involved identifying the null values and addressing them appropriately to ensure the dataset's accuracy and consistency. By handling these data issues in Excel beforehand, I ensured a smooth transition to the SQL environment and prevented potential problems during data analysis. This careful preparation was crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data and obtaining reliable results from subsequent analyses.
